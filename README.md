# Partitioning_ANN
Partitioning using ANN

This set of codes applies the partitioning of NEE measured with eddy covariance in the two components GPP and RECO using an approach based on Artificial Neural Networks as described in Tramontana et al. 2020. The codes are in MATLAB and have been used and tested in the versions 2011a and 2019a. It requires the Toolbox for the ANN training (Neural Net or following versions).
